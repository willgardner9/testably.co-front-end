# Testably (front end)

Testably is a micro-SaaS product providing easy-to-use A/B testing tools for startups and small businesses. I developed Testably after growing frustrated in my day job about the lack of simple, affordable A/B testing solutions available for startups. Testably is built with Express and MongoDB on the back end and Vue.js with Nuxt.js on the front end.
